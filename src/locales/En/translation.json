  "about-text": "You are probably aware that from the last three months of 2024 to the first three months of 2026, there will be a one-and-a-half-year period of cryptocurrency miracles. The only similar example of cryptocurrency growth during this period is the growth of cryptocurrencies in the last three months of 2017, and perhaps this period will not repeat with such intensity for a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have previously been active in the world of cryptocurrencies, you probably know that people lose a lot of money in this market for various reasons. Some of these reasons include incorrect analysis, impulsive buying or selling, and not following an effective trading strategy.\n\nxTrust, by utilizing a professional trading team, aims to help you achieve the maximum profit with the least risk from this market. You can see some of the team's previous successful predictions on our social media networks. xTrust has also used a smart contract-based system to build investor trust and allow continuous monitoring of operations, ensuring that investors are always aware of their capital and can withdraw their funds whenever they want.\n\nAll trading team operations are conducted exclusively on the decentralized exchange Pancake Swap V2. Additionally, to build user trust, all trading operations are performed on a limited number of cryptocurrencies. The list of these cryptocurrencies is available on the {smartContractButton} page.\n\nDue to the operational nature of this decentralized exchange, the trading team cannot use any leverage in this market. All trades will be conducted with a leverage of 1, and profits will only come from price increases. These features will result in the least risk for users' capital.\n\nHere, you can invest or add to your investment at any time and in any amount using the Tether (USDT) cryptocurrency. Investors can also withdraw any amount of their profit or capital from the smart contract at any time and transfer it to their wallet. The rules related to profit calculation and system fees are available on the {termsButton} page.",
